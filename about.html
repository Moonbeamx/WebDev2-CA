    <h1>About Myself</h1>
    <img src="images/me2.jpg" alt="Me" width="400" height="300" /> <p> My name is Sarah Mooney. I'm born and bred in Rathfarnham in the beautiful city of Dubin. I'm 22 years young and I'm studying Creative Digital Media in Blanchardstown IT. I also have a diploma in Event Management & PR. My passions are Music & Art. I have many hobbies that I like to intertwine with my ideas and designs so my work is always quite braod and divergent. I use my DSLR Canon 1200D to capture all my photos and videos. I work with different programs such as iMovie, Photoshop, Illustrator and I also design Websites using Dreamweaver. All of the work you see on my website is done by myself. Thanks again for visiting, and I really hope you enjoy my work. If you have any queries, questions or requests please feel free to drop me a <a href="contact.html">mail</a>. I look forward to hearing from you! :)</p>
